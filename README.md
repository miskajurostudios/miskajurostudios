I use HTML, CSS, Python and a bit of JavaScript ('a bit' = console.log("Hello World") just so you know :D)

## I started with
I started with simple scripts in VBS and BATCH, just to learn the basics.
I donâ€™t use it anymore, but it was a "great" start.
Then I moved on to HTML and experimented a bit
before diving into game engines like GDevelop, Unreal, and Godot.
After that, I focused on Python and advanced HTML.
